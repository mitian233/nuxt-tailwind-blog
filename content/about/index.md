Hello!

Thank you for visiting my site. You came to see my introduction, didn't you? I'm a little embarrassed (////). It took half a day to make this site, but I don't know what to write here. Let's use this as an extension document ~

I'm Mikan, a BanG Dreamer. About my name Mikan, this word looks same in Japanese and Chinese -- Mikan. So there is no communication barrier. The meaning is from two characters I like: Chika Takami and Kasumi Toyama. Chika she is the ambassador of the Nishiura Mikan. Toyama sounds like another Chinese homophone for Mandarin oranges, and the name comes(LOL).

This site, I think Vuejs is easy to use, so I made it with Vuejs. The source code is open source, so if you think it's good, you can find it on Github and change the source code a little bit to make it your own (please follow the open source license).

I've been doing web for 20 years, and now I can only write stupid code, but I'll keep trying. (But I'm not a software engineering major, so I guess it's okay?)

To friends who want to make friends with me:

I'm a little shy, so I don't look for a conversation partner. But if you want to talk and become friends, I'm happy. My SNS account is on the top page. If possible, please PM me directly and I will reply to you as soon as possible ~

I'm not good at English, so I'm sorry if I make a mistake. I hope you can understand me. Thank you for your visit ~
